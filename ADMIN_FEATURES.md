- **Pagination**: Ready for implementation when datasets grow large
- **Caching**: API responses can be cached for better performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Debounced Filters**: Prevent excessive API calls during filtering

## Maintenance

### Database Migrations
- Migration script provided for adding reason field to vehicle availability
- Future schema changes should follow similar pattern
- Backup database before running migrations

### Monitoring
- Check dashboard statistics regularly
- Monitor for failed operations in logs
- Review booking patterns and vehicle utilization
- Track system performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of admin endpoints
- **Backup/Restore**: Automated backup and restore functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Cannot connect to admin endpoints**: Ensure backend server is running
2. **Vehicle creation fails**: Check for duplicate registrations
3. **Cannot delete vehicle**: Ensure no active bookings exist
4. **Booking status not updating**: Check network connection and server logs
5. **Dashboard not loading**: Verify database connection and admin endpoints

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify network requests in browser dev tools
3. Check backend server logs for API errors
4. Ensure database is accessible and contains data
5. Verify all required fields are filled in forms

This admin panel provides a comprehensive solution for managing the car booking system with a user-friendly interface and robust backend functionality.
