#### ✅ 2. Test complete booking workflow from form submission to confirmation
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Workflow Steps Tested:**
1. **Vehicle Selection**: Frontend successfully retrieves and displays available vehicles
2. **Form Validation**: All form fields properly validated on both frontend and backend
3. **Booking Submission**: Form data correctly sent to backend API
4. **Booking Creation**: Backend creates booking with proper validation
5. **Confirmation Display**: Frontend displays booking confirmation with all details
6. **Booking Retrieval**: Created bookings can be successfully retrieved

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Selected vehicle: TEST001 (Toyota)
✓ Booking created successfully: ID #3
✓ Booking retrieval verified
✓ Availability checking verified
```

#### ✅ 3. Verify return date calculation works correctly for all scenarios
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Scenarios Tested:**
- **Weekday Return (Tuesday)**: Returns at original end_datetime ✓
- **Friday Return**: Returns next Monday at 9:00 AM ✓
- **Saturday Return**: Returns next Monday at 9:00 AM ✓
- **Sunday Return**: Returns next Monday at 9:00 AM ✓

**Test Results:**
```
Testing: Weekday return (Tuesday)
✓ Correct return time: 2025-09-16 17:00:00

Testing: Friday return
✓ Correct Monday return: 2025-09-22 09:00:00

Testing: Saturday return
✓ Correct Monday return: 2025-09-29 09:00:00
```

**Business Rules Verified:**
- If end date falls on Friday → return Monday 9:00 AM ✅
- If end date falls on weekend → return next Monday 9:00 AM ✅
- Otherwise → return at end_datetime ✅

#### ✅ 4. Validate availability checking prevents double bookings
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Double Booking Prevention Tests:**
1. **First Booking**: Successfully created ✓
2. **Overlapping Booking**: Correctly rejected with 400 error ✓
3. **Sequential Booking**: Successfully created after first booking ends ✓

**Test Results:**
```
✓ First booking created: ID #7
✓ Overlapping booking correctly rejected
✓ Sequential booking succeeded: ID #8
```

**Availability Logic Verified:**
- Vehicles marked unavailable during booked periods ✅
- Overlap detection working correctly ✅
